
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE:

Advantages  
	Some of the advantages are: 

	1) It is centralised, which means that all data and services are stored and managed in a single place. This makes it easier to maintain, update, and secure the system. 

	2) It is cost-efficient, as it requires less hardware and software resources for the client side. The client only needs a network connection and an application or web browser to access the server. 

	3) It has high performance and low latency, as the server can handle many requests from many clients simultaneously and efficiently. 

Disadvantages 
	Some of the disadvantages are: 

	1) It has limited scalability, as it depends on the capacity and availability of the server. If the server is overloaded or fails, the system may not function properly or at all. 

	2) It has high network dependency, as it relies on the network connection between the client and the server. If the network is slow or disrupted, the system may experience delays or errors. 

	3) It has complex architecture, as it involves multiple components and layers that need to be designed, implemented, and coordinated. The system may also face challenges such as security, synchronisation, and compatibility. 
	
	
OSI MODEL:

	OSI Model image = https://www.imperva.com/learn/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2020/02/OSI-7-layers.jpg.webp
	
	
	7.Application Layer:

PORTS IN NETWORKING		
	-> When ever any application in one computer sends data to another application of a different computer then it sends using IP address and MAC Address.
	-> The System undrestands that this data is for a specific application through the port mentioned 
	-> In a computer data is first received using their IP or MAC address then it is delivered to application whose port number is with the data packets
	
	TYPES OF PORTS:
		->Well Known Ports
			->It is from the range 0 to 1023
			->It is reserved for common and specifically used services 
			->It is used by widely adopted protocols and services like HTTP(port 80), FTP(port 21), DNS(port 53), SSH(port 22) etc.
		->Registered Ports
			->It is from range 1024 to 49151
			->These are used by applications or services that are not as common 
			->But it is used by those application or services which require its specific port
			->Organizations can ask IANA(Internet Assigned Number Authority) for any specific port number within this range 
		->Dynamic Ports
			->It is from range 49152 to 65535
			->It is also known as Ephermeral or PRivate PORT

MODEM VS ROUTER:
	
	MODEM IMAGE = https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20230826113414/Modembak.png
	
	->A Modem is short form of modulator/demodulator. The Modem is a hardware component that can connect and other devices such as routers and switches to the internet
	->Modems convert or modulate the anlog signals coming from telephone wire into a digital form that is in the form of 0s ans 1.
	->It acts as a bridge between the telephone line and the computer . it converts the input analog signal to a digital and directs it ti the conputer and vice versa
	
	
	ROUTER IMAGE = https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Network_devices.jpg
	
	->The router is supposed to connect totally different networks along. 
	->The essential distinction between electronic equipment and a modem router is that electronic equipment is necessary for connecting your electronic network to the web whereas, a router is crucial to direct the trail to the traffic of information packets on the network.


							MODEM																									ROUTER
-> The modem is crucial to access the net because it connects your laptop to ISP.							-> While in which you can access the net while not employing a router.
-> In modem, the information packet is not examined; thus, the security threat is often there.				-> While in the router, the information packet is always examined before forwarding it, to work out the threat.
-> It is placed straight to the computer or it is also placed between a telephone line and a router.		-> While a router is placed between electronic equipment and a network.
-> The modem performs signal decoding by decoding the ISP signal.											-> While a router does not perform signal decoding.
-> Modem brings the requested info from the net to your network.											-> While the router distributes that requested data to your PC.
-> Modem is not secure.																						-> Router is highly secure.
-> Modem works on the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model														-> Router works on the Physical Layer and Network Layer of the OSI Model.


	TYPES OF MODEM:
		->DIAL UP: This is one of the earlier types of modem connection that uses a phone line to connect to an Internet Service Provider, But these are very slow modems.
		->DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE: DSL provides high speed internet access over telephonic lines, but they operate on different frequency bands.
		->SATELLITE MODEM: They are used for accessing the internet over satellite communication, they are used in that area where the normal internet connection is not possible.
		->CABLE: These are those modems that use a cable TV line to connect with an Internet Service Provider. This is the highly used type of modem connection.
		->INTERNAL MODEM: The internal modem is connected inside the system/computer system, due to which its rate of data transmission is very slow and its installation is quite complex.
		->EXTERNAL MODEM: An external provides modem is connected outside the system/computer system by using a cable , it provide high data transmission rate, it is a alittle bit expensive but its installation is very easy.
		->Two-wire Modem: It uses a pair of wire that is why its called Two-wire Modem, these two wires are used for incoming and outgoing signals.
		->Four-wire Modem: It uses the pair of wires for incoming and outgoing signal. So it is double of Two-wire Modem, that’s why this is called Four-wire Modem.

TOPOLOGY:
	1.Point To Point Topology:
		image = https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240614235231/Point-to-point-topology.png
		->Point to Point is a simple topology thay directly limks two nodes and reserves the entire bandwidth of the connection for them to communicate with one another
		->Physically point to point connections rely on a cable or wire that connects the two encpoints. 
		->However logical topological connections using satellite links and microwaves aremore common now a days
	
	2. Bus Topology:
		image = https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/3-55.png
		-> In a bus topology all the nodes are linked using a single cable with terminator on both ends.
		-> This configuration sees one main cable acting as the backbone for the whole network
		
	3. Ring Topology:

PEER TO PEER ARCHITECTURE:
	
	IMAGE = https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220826190244/GFGP2PArchitecture.png
	
	->Peer to peer architecture customizes the protocols to ensure decentralized networks can support specific use cases 
	->The purpose of the protocols is to ensure that the data is distributed across the network and that nodes can locate and exchange data with each other 

	PROS:
		-> There is no single point of failure since the network is not dependent on a central server.If one nodes fails the network can still function 
		->P2P networks will narutally scale out network resources as more peers join 
		->Since there is no need for a central server the cosr of setting up and maintaining the network can be lower 
		->P2P networks can offer a degree of anonymity and privacy since there isno central authority controlling or monitoring thr network 
	CONS:
		->Without a cntral authority it can be challenging to enforce network security policies uniformly across all nodes 
		->It can be difficult to ensure data integrity across all peers if nodes randomly join and leave 
		->While P2P networks can scale easily the performance can degreade if too many oeers need to access the same resources simultaneously
		->Without central control it can be difficult to prevent the distribution of harmful or unethical content
